Provides shortcodes for each tab of the Affiliate Area

== Description ==

> This plugin requires [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") in order to function.

Once activated, this plugin provides a shortcode for each tab of the affiliate area:

[affiliate_area_graphs]

[affiliate_area_settings]

[affiliate_area_creatives]

[affiliate_area_referrals]

[affiliate_area_stats]

[affiliate_area_urls]

[affiliate_area_visits]

Although the tabs in the affiliate area can be easily removed or reordered using the [dashboard.php template file](http://docs.affiliatewp.com/article/118-modifying-template-files "Modifying template files"), some customers prefer the use of shortcodes.

With the above shortcodes you'll be able to:


1. Create an Affiliate Area (without tabs) and stack them in any order on one page.
2. Put each shortcode on a separate page, essentially creating your own page structure.
3. Have more control over which areas the affiliates see, without having to modify the [template files](http://docs.affiliatewp.com/article/118-modifying-template-files "Modifying template files").

Just remember to set your Affiliate Area page in Affiliates &rarr; Settings to be your [login page](http://docs.affiliatewp.com/article/98-affiliatelogin "Affiliate Login Shortcode") or your affiliates will have no where to login from via emails etc.
